# NLP

This project is focused on answering three main questions: 1) How many publications have there been each year on ACG? 2) What is the frequency of publications by country? and 3) What are the themes found in these publications?

The first two questions can be answered using tidy data principles and the third will require a text analytics package like tidytext, tm, and others.
